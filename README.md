## About the Project

### Background

I am a junior data scientists on the Zillow data science team. I through my exploration of or data I have found some features that could be driving the errors in the Zestimates for single unit/single family homes in 2017?". 


Acknowledgement:The dataset was provided by Codeup from the MySequel Database

### Goals

My goal for this project is to create a model that will find what is driving the errors in the Zestimates of single unit properties in 2017 by including clustering methodologies. I will deliver the following in a github repository:

- A clearly named final notebook. This notebook will be what I present and will contain plenty of markdown documentation and cleaned up code.
- A README that explains what the project is, how to reproduce you work, and your notes from project planning
- A Python module or modules that automate the data acquisistion and preparation process. These modules should be imported and used in your final notebook.
